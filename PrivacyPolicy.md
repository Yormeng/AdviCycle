# Privacy Policy

Effective date: February 9, 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how this AdviCycle (the “App”) handles your information. We designed the App to provide clothing advice based on current or forecasted weather conditions and optional manual inputs.

**What we collect**
- Location information (optional): If you grant permission, the App uses your device’s location to fetch local weather and provide advice. Your precise location is used only for this purpose.
- Weather data: The App requests weather information from Apple Weather (or your configured weather provider via system APIs). The requests may include coordinates and time to retrieve a forecast.
- Manual inputs: You may enter weather values manually (e.g., temperature, wind, precipitation). These inputs stay on your device unless you explicitly share them using the share feature.
- Diagnostics (optional): If you have system analytics enabled, Apple may provide anonymized, aggregated diagnostics. The App itself does not collect analytics beyond what the operating system provides.

**How we use information**
- To provide features: Location and weather data are used to show current conditions, forecasts, and clothing advice.
- To improve reliability: Basic, anonymized diagnostics from the OS (if enabled) may help us understand crashes or performance issues.

**Data storage and retention**
- On-device storage: The App may store your last selected location, pinned map coordinates, and preferences (e.g., temperature preference) locally on your device to streamline your experience.
- No account or server: The App does not create a user account or operate its own backend server for your personal data.
- Retention: On-device data remains until you delete the App or reset the App’s data. Weather responses may be cached briefly by the system to improve performance.

**Sharing of information**
- Third parties: The App does not sell or rent your personal information. Weather requests may be processed by Apple services or the configured weather provider through system APIs.
- System services: Location access and weather retrieval use Apple frameworks that follow Apple’s privacy and security guidelines.
- Sharing content: If you choose to share advice (e.g., via the share sheet), the App composes text from on-device values and sends it only to the destination you select.

**Your choices and controls**
- Location permissions: You can grant, deny, or revoke location access at any time in your device Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services.
- Data deletion: Delete the App to remove on-device data. You can also clear saved plans or preferences within the App where applicable.
- Notifications: The App does not send push notifications.

**Children’s privacy**
- The App is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

**Security**
- We rely on the security of Apple’s operating systems and frameworks for location and weather data handling. We do not maintain our own servers for user data.

**Changes to this policy**
- We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Material changes will be reflected by updating the “Effective date” above.

**Contact**
- If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact the developer via the App Store listing’s support link or the developer contact provided there.
